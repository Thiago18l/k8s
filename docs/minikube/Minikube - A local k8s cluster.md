# Introduction

As mentioned earlier, Minikube is the easiest and most popular method to run an all-in-one Kubernetes cluster in a virtual machine (VM) locally on our workstations. Minikube is the tool responsible for the installation of Kubernetes components, cluster bootstrapping, and cluster tear-down when no longer needed. It includes a few additional tools aimed to ease the user interaction with the Kubernetes cluster, but nonetheless, it initializes for us an all-in-one single-node Kubernetes cluster. While the latest Minikube release also supports multi-node Kubernetes clusters, this feature is still experimental. 

In this chapter, we will explore the requirements to install Minikube locally on our workstation, together with the installation instructions to set it up on local Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems.
