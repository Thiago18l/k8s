# **Infrastructure for Kubernetes Installation**

Once we decide on the installation type, we need to decide on the infrastructure. Infrastructure related decisions are typically guided by the desired environment type, either learning or production environment. For infrastructure, we need to decide on the following:

- Should we set up Kubernetes on bare metal, public cloud, private, or hybrid cloud?
- Which underlying OS should we use? Should we choose a Linux distribution such as RHEL, CentOS, CoreOS, or Windows?
- Which networking solution should we use?
